\section{Data}\label{section:data}

This section introduces the data used by LDBC-SNB. This includes the different
data types, the data schema, how it is generated and the different scale
factors.

\subsection{Data Types}
Table~\ref{table:types} describes the different types used in the whole benchmark.

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|p{2.5cm}|p{13cm}|}
    \hline
    \textbf{Type} & \textbf{Description} \\
    \hline
    ID &  integer type with 64-bit precision. All IDs within a single entity, are unique\\
    \hline
    32-bit Integer &  integer type with 32-bit precision\\
    \hline
    64-bit Integer &  integer type with 64-bit precision\\
    \hline
    String & variable length text of size 40\\
    \hline
    Text &  variable length text of size 2000\\
    \hline
    Date &  date with a precision of a day, encoded as a string with the following format: \textit{yyyy-mm-dd}, where \textit{yyyy} is a four-digit integer representing the year,
    the year, \textit{mm} is a two-digit integer representing the month and dd is a two-digit integer representing the day. \\
    \hline
    DateTime &  date with a precision of miliseconds, encoded as a string with the following format: \textit{yyyy-mm-ddTHH:MM:ss.sss+0000}, where \textit{yyyy} is a four-digit integer representing the year,
    the year, \textit{mm} is a two-digit integer representing the month and \textit{dd} is a two-digit integer representing the day, \textit{HH} is a two-digit integer representing the hour, \textit{MM} is a two 
    digit integer representing the minute and \textit{ss.sss} is a five digit fixed point real number representing the seconds up to milisecond precision. Finally, the \textit{+0000} of the end represents the
    timezone, which in this case is always GMT.\\
    \hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Description of the data types.}
\label{table:types}
\end{table}


\subsection{Data Schema}

Figure~\ref{figure:schema} shows the data schema in UML. The schema defines the
structure of the data used in the benchmark in terms of entities and their
relations. Data represents a snapshot of the activity of a social network
during a period of time. Data includes entities such as Persons, Organizations,
and Places. The schema also models the way persons interact, by means of the
friendship relations established with other persons, and the sharing of content
such as messages (both textual and images), replies to messages and likes to
messages.  People form groups to talk about specific topics, which are
represented as tags.

LDBC-SNB has been designed to be flexible and to target systems of different
nature and characteristics. As such, it does not force any particular internal
representation of the schema. The DATAGEN described in
Section~\ref{section:data_generation} supports multiple output data formats to
fit the needs of different types of systems, including RDF, relational DBMS and
graph DBMS.

\begin{landscape}

        \caption{The LDBC-SNB data schema}
        \label{figure:schema}
    \end{figure}
\end{landscape}

The schema specifies different entities, their attributes and their relations.
All of them are described in the following sections.

\flushleft{\textbf{Textual Restrictions}}

\subsection{Data Generation}\label{section:data_generation}

LDBC-SNB provides DATAGEN (Data Base Generator), which produces synthetic
datasets following the schema described above. Data
produced mimics a social network's activity during a period of time. Three
parameters determine the generated data: the number of persons, the number of
years simulated, and the starting year of simulation. DATAGEN is defined by the
following characteristics:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Realism.} Data generated by DATAGEN mimics the
        characteristics of those found in a real social network. In DATAGEN,
        output attributes, cardinalities, correlations and distributions have
        been finely tuned to reproduce a real social network in each of its
        aspects On the one hand, it is aware of the  data and link distributions
        found in a real social network such as Facebook. On the other hand, it
        uses real data from DBPedia, such as property dictionaries, which are
        used to ensure that attribute values are realistic and correlated.
    \item \textbf{Scalability.} Since LDBC-SNB targets systems of different
        scales and budgets, DATAGEN is capable of generating datasets of
        different sizes, from a few Gigabytes to Terabytes. DATAGEN is
        implemented following the MapReduce parallel paradigm, allowing the
        generation of small datasets in single node machines, as well as large
        datasets on commodity clusters.
    \item \textbf{Determinism.} DATAGEN is deterministic regardless of the number
        of cores/machines used to produce the data. This important feature
        guarantees that all Test Sponsors will face the same dataset,
        thus, making the comparisons between different systems fair and the
        benchmarks' results reproducible.
    \item \textbf{Usability.} LDBC-SNB is designed to have an affordable entry
        point. As such, DATAGEN's design is  severely influenced by this
        philosophy, and therefore it is designed to be as easy to use as
        possible.
\end{itemize}


\subsubsection{Resource Files}

DATAGEN uses a set of resource files with data
extracted from DBpedia. Conceptually, DATAGEN generates attribute's
values following a property dictionary model that is defined by

\begin{itemize}
    \item a dictionary $D$
    \item a ranking function $R$
    \item a probability function $F$
\end{itemize}

Dictionary D is a fixed set of values. The ranking function R is a bijection
that assigns to each value in a dictionary a unique rank between 1 and |$D$|.
The probability density function $F$ specifies how the data generator chooses
values from dictionary $D$ using the rank for each term in the dictionary. The
idea to have a separate ranking and probability function is motivated by the
need of generating correlated values: in particular, the ranking function is
typically parameterized by some parameters: different parameter values result
in different rankings. For example, in the case of a dictionary of property
firstName, the popularity of first names, might depend on the gender, country
and birthDate properties. Thus, the fact that the popularity of first names in
different countries and times is different, is reflected by the different ranks
produced by function $R$ over the full dictionary of names.  DATAGEN uses a
dictionary for each literal property, as well as ranking functions for all
literal properties. These are materialized in a set of resource files, which
are described in Table~\ref{table:property_dictionaries}.

\begin{table}[H]
\begin{tabular}{|p{4cm}|p{12cm}|}
    \hline
    \textbf{Resource Name} & \textbf{Description} \\
    \hline
    Browsers & Contains a list of web browsers and their probability to be used. It is used to set the browsers used by the users.\\

\end{table}

\subsubsection{Graph Generation}

Figure~\ref{figure:generation_process} conceptually depicts the full data
generation process. The first step loads all the dictionaries and resource
files, and initializes the DATAGEN parameters.  Second, it generates all the
Persons in the graph, and the minimum necessary information to operate. Part of
these information are the interests of the persons, and the number of knows
relationships of every person, which is guided by a degree distribution
function similar to that found in Facebook~\cite{facebook_anatomy}.

The next three steps are devoted to the creation of knows relationships.  An
important aspect of real social networks, is the fact that similar persons
(with similar interests and behaviors) tend to be connected. This is known as
the Homophily principle~\cite{mcpherson2001birds}, and implies the presence of
a larger amount of triangles than that expected in a random network. In order
to reproduce this characteristic, DATAGEN generates the edges by means of
correlation dimensions.  Given a person, the probability to be connected to
another person is typically skewed with respect to some similarity between the
persons. That is, for a person $n$ and for a small set of persons that are
somehow similar to it, there is a high connectivity probability, whereas for
most other persons, this probability is quite low. This knowledge is
exploited by DATAGEN to reproduce correlations.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{figures/sndg/execution.pdf}
    \caption{The DATAGEN generation process.}
    \label{figure:generation_process}
\end{figure}

Given a similarity function $M(x) : n → [0, \infty]$ that gives a score to a person,
with the characteristic that two similar persons will have similar scores, we
can sort all the persons by function $M$ and compare a person n against only the
W neighboring persons in the sorted array. The consequence of this approach is
that similar persons are grouped together, and the larger the
distance between two persons indicates a monotonic increase in their similarity
difference. In order to choose the persons to connect, DATAGEN uses a geometric
probability distribution that provides a probability for picking persons to
connect, that are between 1 and $W$ positions apart in the similarity
ranking.

Similarity functions and probability distribution functions over ranked
distance drive what kind of persons will be connected with an edge, not how
many. As stated above, the number of friends of a person is determined by a
Facebook-like distribution. The edges that will be connected to a person $n$,
are selected by randomly picking the required number of edges according to the
correlated probability distributions as discussed before. In the case that
multiple correlations exist, another probability function is used to divide the
intended number of edges between the various correlation dimensions. In DATAGEN,
three correlated dimensions are chosen: the first one depends on where the
person studied and when, and the second correlation dimension depends on the
interests of the person, and the third one is random (to reproduce the random
noise present in real data). Thus, DATAGEN has a Facebook-like distributed node
degree, and a predictable (but not fixed) average split between the reasons for
creating edges.

In the next step, person's activity, in the form of forums, posts and comments
is created. DATAGEN reproduces the fact that people with a larger number of
friends have a higher activity, and hence post more photos and comments to a
larger number of posts. Another important characteristic of real users'
activity in social network, are time correlations.  Usually, users' posts
creation in a social network is driven by real world events.  For
instance, one may think about an important event such as the elections in a
country, or a natural disaster. Around the time these events occur, network
activity about these events' topics sees an increase in volume. DATAGEN
reproduces these characteristics with the simulation of what we name as
flashmob events.  Several events are generated randomly at the beginning of the
generation process, which are assigned a random tag, and are given a time and
an intensity which represents the repercussion of the event in the real world.
When persons' posts are created, some of them are classified as flashmob posts,
and their topics and dates are assigned based on the generated flashmob events.
The volume of activity around this events is modeled following a model similar
to that described in~\cite{flashmobs}. Furthermore, in order to reproduce the
more uniform every day's user activity, DATAGEN also generates post uniformly
distributed along all the simulated time.

Finally, in the last step the data is serialized into the output files.

\subsubsection{Implementation Details}

DATAGEN is implemented using the MapReduce parallel paradigm. In MapReduce, a
Map function runs on different parts of the input data, in parallel and on many
node clusters. This function processes the input data and produces for each
result a key. Reduce functions then obtain this data and Reducers run in
parallel on many cluster nodes. The produced key simply determines the Reducer
to which the results are sent. The use of the MapReduce paradigm allows the
generator to scale considerably, allowing the generation of huge datasets by
using clusters of machines.

In the case of DATAGEN, the overall process is divided into three MapReduce jobs.
In the first job, each mapper generates a subset of the persons of the graph. A
key is assigned to each person using one of the similarity functions described
above. Then, reducers receive the the key-value pairs sorted by the key,
generate the knows relations following the described windowing process, and
assign to each person a new key based on another similarity function, for the
next MapReduce pass.  This process can be successively repeated for additional
correlation dimension.  Finally, the last reducer generates the remaining
information such as forums, posts and comments.

\subsubsection{Data Output}

DATAGEN is built to split the simulated social network into two parts: the static
part and the update stream part.  The static part contains the data that will
be bulk loaded by the Test Sponsor's system and  is formatted in one of the
supported formats: CSV, CSV\_MERGE\_FOREIGN and TTL. In addition
to the network data, a stream of reads is also produced, which is used
by the test driver to execute the queries. A detailed description of
each supported format and the generated files is described in
Section~\ref{section:serializers}. For a description of how the read stream is
generated, please refer to Section~\ref{section:substitution}.
The update streams part contains update events to the network, consisting in
insertions of data, and is also used by the test driver to issue updates.

What percentage of the network is output as static, and what percentage is
output as updates, can be configured and depends on the needs of the workload.
To compute what data goes to each of the parts, a point or threshold in the
simulated time line is computed. All entities that fall before the threshold,
go to the static part. All entities falling after the threshold, are output as
update streams. Consequently, if a relation contains one of the entities
falling into the update stream, then the relation is also output as an update.

As currently the only supported workload is the Interactive Workload with only
lookups, DATAGEN is configured to output the  entire 100\% of the network as
static by default.

\subsection{Scale Factors}

LDBC-SNB defines a set of scale factors (SFs), targeting systems of different
sizes and budgets.  SFs are computed based on the ASCII size in Gigabytes of
the generated output files using the CSV serializer. For example, SF 1 weights roughly 1GB in CSV
format, SF 3 weights roughly 3GB and so on and so forth.  The proposed SFs are
the following: 1, 3, 10, 30, 100, 300, 1000. The Test Sponsor may select the SF
that better fits their needs, by properly configuring the DATAGEN, as described
in Section~\ref{section:data_generation}.

The size of the resulting dataset, is mainly affected by the following
configuration parameters: the number of persons and the number of years
simulated. Different SFs are computed by scaling the number of Persons in
the network, while fixing the number of years simulated.
Table~\ref{tab:snsize} shows the parameters used in each of the SFs.

\begin{table}[H]

\begin{tabular}{|c||r|r|r|r|r|r|r|}
\hline  Scale Factor  & 1 &  3 & 10 & 30 & 100 & 300 & 1000 \\
\hline  \# of Persons  & 11K &  27K & 73K & 182K & 499K & 1.25M & 3.6M \\
\hline  \# of Years  & 3 &  3 & 3 & 3 & 3 & 3 & 3 \\
\hline  Start Year & 2010 &  2010 & 2010 & 2010 & 2010 & 2010 & 2010 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\caption{Parameters of each scale factor.}
\label{tab:snsize}
\end{table}

For example, SF 30 consists of the activity of a social network of 182K users
during a period of three years, starting from 2010. In
Appendix~\ref{appendix:scale_factors}, we show the statistics of each of the
proposed SFs in detail, including distributions for some of the relations.
