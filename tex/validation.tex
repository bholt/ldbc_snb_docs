\section{Validation}

LDBC-SNB driver provides a validation mechanism to test the correctness of a benchmark 
workload implementation. To use it, one must provide a validation dataset, which contains
the following items:
\begin{itemize}
    \item a set of substituion parameters;
    \item a set of expected results;
    \item the dataset;
    \item a driver configuration file.
\end{itemize}

Validation datasets are provided by LDBC-SNB, and can be found in the official github 
LDBC repository. 
Once the vendor has implemented the workload, it must load the provided dataset and run
the benchmark with the ``validatedatabase'' option set. With this option, the
driver will read the file with the expected results, and compare them with the results
obtained by the vendor. For more information visit the ldbc driver page.
