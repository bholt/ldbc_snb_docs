\section{Motivation for the Benchmark}

The new era of data economy, based on large, distributed and complexly
structured data sets, has brought on new and complex challenges in the field of
data management and analytics. These data sets, usually modeled as large
graphs, have attracted both the industry and academia, due to the new
opportunities in research and innovation they offer.  This situation has also
opened the door for new companies to emerge, offering new non-relational and
graph-like technologies that are called to play a significant role in upcoming
years.

The change in the data paradigm, calls for new benchmarks to test the  new
emerging technologies, as they set a framework where different systems can
compete and compare in a fair way, they let technology providers to identify
the bottlenecks and gaps of their systems and, in general, drive the research
and development of new information technology solutions. Without them, the
uptake of these technologies is at risk by not providing the industry with
clear, user-driven targets for performance and functionality.

The LDBC Social Network Benchmark (LDBC-SNB) aims at being comprehensive
benchmark setting the rules for the evaluation of graph-like data management
technologies.  LDBC-SNB is designed to be a plausible look-alike of all the
aspects of operating a social network site, as one of the most representative
and relevant use case of modern graph-like applications. LDBC-SNB is a work in
progress, and initially, it only includes the Interactive Workload,
but two more workloads will be introduced in the future: the Business
Intelligence and the Analytics. By designing three separate workloads, LDBC-SNB
targets a broader range of systems with different nature and characteristics.
LDBC-SNB aims at capturing the essential features of these usage scenarios
while abstracting away details of specific business deployments.

\section{Relevance to Industry}

LDBC-SNB is intended to provide the following value to different stakeholders:

\begin{itemize}
 \item For \textbf{end users} facing graph processing tasks, LDBC-SNB provides
     a recognizable scenario against which it is possible to compare merits of
     different products and technologies.  By covering a wide variety of scales
     and price points, LDBC-SNB can serve as an aid to technology selection.
 \item For \textbf{vendors} of graph database technology, LDBC-SNB provides a
     checklist of features and performance characteristics that helps in
     product positioning and can serve to guide new development.
 \item For \textbf{researchers}, both industrial and academic, the LDBC-SNB
     dataset and workload provide interesting challenges in multiple
     choke-point areas, such as query optimization, (distributed) graph
     analysis, transactional throughput, and provides a way to objectively
     compare the effectiveness and efficiency of new and existing technology in
     these areas.
\end{itemize}

The technological scope of the LDBC-SNB comprises all systems that one might
conceivably use to perform social network data management tasks:

\begin{itemize}
 \item \textbf{Graph database systems} (e.g. Neo4j, InfiniteGraph, Sparksee,
     Titan) are novel technologies aimed at storing directed and labeled
     graphs. They support graph traverals, typically by means of APIs, though
     some of them also support some sort of graph oriented query language (e.g.
     Neo4j's Cypher). These systems' internal structures are typically designed
     to store dynamic graphs that change over time.  They oftern support
     transactional queries with some degree of consistency, and value-based
     indexes to quicly locate nodes and edges. Finally, their architecture is
     typically single-machine (non-cluster). These systems can 
     potentially implement the three workloads, though Interactive and Business Intelligence
     workloads are where they will presumably be more competitive.
 \item \textbf{Graph programming frameworks} (e.g. Giraph, Signal/Collect,
     Graphlab, Green Marl) are designed to perform global graph queries
     computations, executed in parallel or lockstep. These computations are typically
     long latency, involving many nodes and edges and often consist of approximation
     answers to NP-complete problems. These systems expose an API, sometimes following
     a vertex centric paradigm, and their architecture targets both single-,machine and
     cluster systems. Though these systems will likely implement the Graph Analytics workload.
 \item \textbf{RDF database systems} (e.g. OWLIM, Virtuoso, BigData, Jena TDB,
     Stardog, Allegrograph) are systems that implement the SPARQL1.1 query
     language, similar in complexity to SQL1992, which allows for structured
     queries, and simple traversals. RDF database system often come with
     additional support for simple reasoning (sameAs,subClass), text search and
     geospatial predicates.  RDF database systems generally support
     transactions, but not always with full concurrency and serializability and
     their supposed strength is integrating multiple data sources (e.g.
     DBpedia). Their architecture is both single-machine and clustered, and
     they will likely target Interactive and Business Intelligence workloads.
 \item \textbf{Relational database systems} (e.g. Postgres, MySQL, Oracle, DB2,
     SQLserver, Virtuoso, MonetDB, Vectorwise, Vertica, but also Hive and
     Impala) treat data as relational, and queries are formulated in SQL and/or
     PL/SQL. Both single-machine and cluster systems exist.  They  do not
     normally support recursion, or stateful recursive algorithms, which makes
     them not at home in the Graph Analytics workloads
 \item \textbf{noSQL database systems} (e.g. key-value stores such as HBase,
     REDIS, MongoDB, CouchDB, or even MapReduce systems like Hadoop and Pig).
     are cluster-vbased and scalable. Key-value stores could possibly implement
     the Interactive Workload, though its navigational aspects would pose some
     problems as potentially many key-value lookups are needed. MapReduce
     systems could be suited for the Graph Analytics workload.  but their query
     latency would presumably be so high that the Business Intelligence
     workload would not make sense, though we note that some of the key-value
     stores (e.g. MongoDB) provide a MapReduce query functionality on the data
     that it stores which could make it suited for the Business Intelligence workload.
\end{itemize}

\section{General Benchmark Overview}

LDBC-SNB aims at being a complete benchmark, designed with the following goals in mind:

\begin{itemize}
 \item \textbf{Rich coverage}. LDBC-SNB is intended to cover most demands
     encountered in the management of complexly structured data. 
 \item \textbf{Modularity}. LDBC-SNB is broken into parts that can be
     individually addressed. In this manner LDBC-SNB
     stimulates innovation without imposing an overly high threshold for
     participation.
 \item \textbf{Reasonable implementation cost}. For a product offering relevant
     functionality, the effort for obtaining initial results with SNB should be
     small, on the order of days.
 \item \textbf{Relevant selection of challenges}. Benchmarks are known to
     direct product development in certain directions. LDBC-SNB is informed by
     the state of the art in database research so as to offer optimization
     challenges for years to come while not having a prohibitively high
     threshold for entry.
 \item \textbf{Reproducibility and documentation of results}. LDBC-SNB
     will specify the rules for full disclosure of benchmark execution and for
     auditing of benchmark runs. The workloads may be run on any equipment
     but the exact configuration and price of the hardware and software must be
     disclosed.
\end{itemize}

LDBC-SNB benchmark is modeled around the operation of a real social network
site. A social network site represents a relevant use case for the following
reasons:

\begin{itemize}
    \item It is simple to understand for a large audience, as it is 
        arguably present to our every-day life in different shapes and forms.  
    \item It allows testing a complete range of interesting
        challenges, by means of different workloads targeting systems of
        different nature and characteristics.
    \item A social network can be scaled, allowing the design of a
        scalable benchmark targeting systems of different sizes and budgets.
\end{itemize}

In Section~\ref{section:data}, LDBC-SNB defines the schema of the data used in
the benchmark. The schema, represents a realistic social network, including
people and their activity in the social network during a period of time.
Personal information of each person, such as the name, the birth day, interests
or the places where people work or study, is included. Persons' activity is
represented in the form of friendhisp relationships and content sharing (i.e
messages and pictures). LDBC-SNB provides a scalable synthetic data generator
based on the MapReduce parallel paradigm, that produces networks with the
described schema with distributions and correlations similar to those expected
in a real social network. Furthermore, the data generator is designed to be
user friendly. The proposed data schema is shared by all the different proposed
workloads, those we currently have, and those that will be proposed in the future.

In Section~\ref{section:workloads}, the Interactive Workload is proposed. 
Two more workloads are planned:  Business Intelligence Workload and
Analytical workload. Workloads are designed to mimic the different usage
scenarios found in operating a real social network site, and each of them
targets one or more types of systems.  Each workload defines a set of queries
and query mixes, designed to stress the SUTs in different choke-point areas,
while being credible and realistic. Interactive workload reproduces the
interaction between the users of the social network by including lookups and
transactions that update small portions of the data base.  These queries are
designed to be interactive and target systems capable of responding such
queries with low latency for multiple concurrent users. Business Intelligence
workload, will represent those business intelligence analytics a social
network company would like to perform in the social network, in order to take
advantage of the data to discover new business opportunities. This workload
will explore moderate portions of data from different entities, and performing more
resource intensive operations. Finally, the graph analytics workload will aim at
exploring the characteristics of the underlying structure of the network. Shortest
paths, community detection or centrality, are representative queries of this workload,
and will imply touching a vast amount of the dataset.
 

LDBC-SNB provides an execution test driver, which is responsible of executing
the workloads and gathering the results. The driver is designed with simplicity
and portability in mind, to ease the implementation on systems with different
nature and characteristics, at a low implementation cost. Furthermore, it
automatically handles the validation of the queries by means of a validation
dataset provided by LDBC.  The overall philosophy of LDBC-SNB is to provide all
the necessary software tools to run the benchmark, and therefore to reduce the
benchmark's entry point as much as possible.

Detailed instructions to generate the required datasets and to run Interactive
Workload of the benchmark, are described in Chapter~\ref{chapter:instructions}.
Finally, in the Appendix, Interactive Workload query implementation examples in
Virtuoso's SQL, Virtuoso's SPARQL and Neo4j Cypher are shown.
